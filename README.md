# Ticket Taylor: technical test

Design and build an event selection drop down for Order search

## 3 hours (suggested time frame)

Event organisers want to filter their customer orders by the event(s) the customer purchased for. To make this easy we want to design and build a simple event selector dropdown that allows the event organiser to select between one and many events.
A list of events could be:

- Summer Party – 15:00 7th July 2023
- Christmas Party – 19:00 18th Dec 2023 Half
- Marathon – 13:00 15th Sept 2024

Please build a blank page with a simple form containing:

- An input that allows you to select zero, one or many events
- A submit button.
- Clicking the submit button should post the selected IDs as a comma separated list.

We will be judging the result on:

- User experience
- Aesthetics
- Functional
- Cleanliness of code

It would be a bonus if you can demonstrate the experience for those who have hundreds of events. You can use jQuery or generic JS helpers, but not implement a library that already does dropdowns. We would like you to ideally spend no more than 3 hours on the task.

Please share your solution via a github link or zip.

On the aesthetics question - its been left deliberately vague - although it is often a good choice to make it look similar to current brand identity.

#### Start

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

#### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

### Feedback

1 week silence, chased.
"The tech test was strong from a design perspective but was not sufficiently on-brief."
